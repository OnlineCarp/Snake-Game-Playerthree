# Snake-Game-Playerthree
Created a snake game for my work experience at Playerthree Ltd.

The following should be read in order:

Snake Movement Client.lua
Server_Handler.lua
Food_Spawner.lua

And all other scripts located in the folder "Module Scripts"

The scripts contained in this repository are the most important ones that makes the game function.
